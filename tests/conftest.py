"""Shared fixtures and helpers for the iadc-tester plugin test suite.

Everything under skills/ is prose written for Claude to read (SKILL.md files), not executable
code — so these tests check what a markdown-instruction skill can actually be checked for:
manifest shape and invocation-address stability (the plugin name and each skill directory's
frontmatter `name` field agreeing with its own directory name). Mirrors IADC-Graph-Plugin's
tests/conftest.py, the family's working reference for this shape (IV-402).
